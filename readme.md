# Transaction App | Api
Our next goal is to build an api utilizing the database we found most efficient in the last assignment.

**NOTE** Since you may be utilizing a database other than postgres you're free to use any orm/query builder you would like. It doesn't have to be knex.
## Goals

Your goal is simple, build a full REST CRUD api around our transactions resource. You don't need to worry about user creation/login/auth for now.

## Tips
You have full freedom to use whatever technologies you would like. If you finish your first api build it again in a different framework and see if you think the other framework is better for our use case.
If you need to jog your memory a bit on what a RESTful api is then you can find our curriculum on rest in the express basics unit on learn.
